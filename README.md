# cifero

A personal Python GUI (PyQt5) program for phonetic transliteration and syllable separation.
Transliterates sentences to and from: dictionary English, IPA, a "typable" IPA, a "readable" IPA, and a phonetic cipher.
Currently punctuation is a problem.

# Installation

Binaries are in "releases".

Locally, at the root directory:
```
pip install .

python cifero
```
This requires/installs PyQt5, which is fairly large.
